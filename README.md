# NodeTypeScript - Starter Node.js app using TypeScript
I don't like to mess with setup everytime I need to prototype or test a new idea, so I keep this simple Node.js project handy, setup with Typescript, as well as Mocha Chai for the test runner.

Also an example test is provided in the test folder.

## Install dependencies 
You will need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) installed on your machine. That is the only prerequisite.

Then run `npm i` to install all local dependencies needed.

## Package Scripts
Start: `npm start`

Build: `npm run build`

Tests: `npm run test`
